    "answer": "<h3>Sustainable Energy</h3><blockquote data-id='test-doc-1' cite='https://windeurope.org/intelligence-platform/product/wind-energy-and-economic-recovery-in-europe/'>Sustainable energy refers to forms of energy that are renewable and environmentally friendly, causing minimal or no harm to the ecosystem. The key characteristics of sustainable energy are:\n\n### Renewable Sources\n- **Derived from natural processes** that are continually replenished.\n- Includes energy from the **sun** (solar power), **wind** (wind power), **water** (hydropower), **geothermal sources** (heat from within the earth), and **biomass** (organic materials)</blockquote><h3>Energy Efficiency</h3><blockquote data-id='test-doc-2' cite='https://unsdg.un.org/resources/green-energy-solar-solutions-practice-note-business-operations-strategy/'>Sustainable energy often involves **using energy more efficiently**.\n- Aims to get **more output from the same amount of energy input**, which reduces overall consumption and minimizes waste.\n\n### Economic Viability\n- Some sustainable energy sources may be more expensive upfront but often lead to **lower long-term costs**.\n- Benefits from factors like **low maintenance requirements** and the **absence of fuel costs**.\n\nThe shift towards sustainable energy is crucial for **reducing our carbon footprint**, **mitigating the effects of climate change**, and ensuring a **stable and secure energy future**. Examples of sustainable energy technologies include **solar panels**, **wind turbines**, **hydroelectric power stations**, and **geothermal energy systems**.</blockquote>",
